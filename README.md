# Final-Project-Building-a-Gaming-Computer

## This is a tutorial for beginners to learn about the parts for building a gaming computer

First start with what gaming computers are and used for

#### Motherboard
   The [motherboard](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/motherboard) is the command center of the computer. It allows the communcation between many important parts of the computer while holding them in place. In gaming the motherboard is a critical part of the build because it determines the power of the other parts that can be placed on it. In other words, if you have better motherboard you can place better parts on it. On the low end you may spend about $60 for a ASRock B450M-HDV motherboard or $350 for the high end Asus ROG Maximus XI Code Z390 Gaming with all the bells and whistles.

#### Central Processing Unit (CPU)
   The CPU is basically the brain of the computer. The [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) executes programs througt the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling and input/output (I/O) operations given by the program. So gamers want to have faster CPU so it can execute programs for the game as fast as possible. In games with a lot going on like Real Time Strategy games with a lot of programs running at once the CPU is more valuable. For gaming a Intel Core i7-8700K for $400 is more than enough for any game on the market right now but if you have a bigger budget you can buy the Intel Core i9-9900K $530.
  
#### Random Access Memory (RAM)
   [RAM](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) is used for the current code that is being ran by the computer. This is another major resource that is used for gaming becasue hardcore gaming uses up a lot of RAM due to the complexity of the code to run games. Generally you want about 16 GBs of RAM for a gaming computer becasue games are getting better and taking up more computer resources as a result. A soild choice for RAM is the G.Skill Ripjaws V 16GB DDR4-2400MHz for $105 or for overkill you can buy the Corsair Dominator Platinum 32GB DDR4-3333MHz for $449.

#### Memory
   [Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory) is the part of the computer is where you store different things like the games that you want to play or other applications that you want to run. There are two types of storage on the market right now, HDD and the newer SSD. HDD are the older model that have actual moving parts on the hardware. SSD are newer comepared to the HDD and are all selfcontained with no moving parts. HDD are much more cheaper for the amount of storage of a SSD but they are slower when starting up the computer. My advice on the matter is get both if possible. With gaming you will need about 1TB of memory, so just get a 500GB SSD and make it the main storage unit so your computer boots up much faster and get a 500GB HDD to help offset some of the cost while still getting about a 1TB of storage. The WD Blue 500GB Desktop Hard Disk Drive - 7200 RPM SATA 6 Gb/s 16MB Cache 3.5 Inch - WD5000AAKX will cost about $35 and the Samsung 850 EVO 500GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E500B/AM) for $111. Apposed to $200 for the Samsung 860 EVO 1TB 2.5 Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-76E1T0B/AM).
  
#### Sound Card
   The [Sound Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_card) is used so that sound can be play from the computer using headphones and external speakers. Sound is very important in gaming but you gernally don't need a super high end sound card unless you want some improvement to the sound. I would recommend the Creative Sound Blaster Audigy FX PCIe 5.1 Sound Card with High Performance Headphone Amp for $23 but if you want more power in the sound department than the Sound Blaster Z PCIe Gaming Sound Card with High Performance Headphone Amp and Beam Forming Microphone for $66 is great.
  
#### Network Interface Controller (NIC)
   Another important piece to the gaming computer puzzle is the [NIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller). It is very important more for competive gamers that mainly play online because with a better NIC you can have a better connection and less latance while playing online. There are two ways you connect to the internet with the NIC and thats WIFI and using a LAN cable. Using a LAN cable is ideal for gaming because it gives you a much more stable connection but it does not hurt to have a good NIC in case you do not have accusse to a LAN at the time. NIC are generally not expensive, like the TP-Link Archer T6E AC1300 PCIe Wireless WiFi network Adapter Card for PC , with Heatsink Technology comes in at $40 but the higher end cards like the TP-Link AC1750 Archer T8E PCI Express Adapter is $155.
  
#### Video Card/ Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
  [GPUs](https://techterms.com/definition/gpu) are the parts that make gamers the most excited becasue they are the part that takes the most stress from the graphics of gaming and allows players to play games smoothly on the highest graphics settings. There are a lot of GPUs on the market but the two main companies are Nvidia and AMD. I only used [Nvidia GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce) so I will speak on them and they are pretty stright foward. They have different gereations for their GPUs:Pre-GeForce, GeForce 256 series, GeForce2 series, GeForce3 series, GeForce4 series, GeForce FX (5xxx) series, GeForce 6 - 9 (6xxx - 9xxx) series, GeForce 100 - 700, 900 series, Volta series, and the GeForce 10 - 20 series. But the viable ones for this day and age of gaming is GeForce 7XX series and up. The GeForce 750 Ti is a great starter GPU for about $150 and if money is not an issue than the beast of a GPU GeForce 2080 Ti with realtime raytracing which is the lastest revolution in gaming which allows actual reflections in-game, this will set you back about $1000.
 
#### Power Supply
  For the [power supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply) you want at least 450 watts for you gaming pc but if you have a much more high end pc you will need more power. They are pretty stright foward. A good starter power suppy is the Bitfenix BF450G at $60 but for more wattage you can buy the Seasonic SSR-600TL for about $200.

#### Cooling
   For [cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cooling) you want to have a good amount of fans to keep the system cool and a seperate fan or liquate cooling for the CPU because all the parts in the PC create heat and that can damage the system over time. A lot of people have about 6 fans built into the case of the PC to keep it cool and buy a cooling system for the CPU which will be about $55 for the MSI CPU Core FrozR L Cooler or Arctic Liquid Freezer 120 $85.

#### Case
   The [case](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-computer-case-2618149) may not be a mechanical part of the computer but it still is an important one none the less. It holds all the parts together and can have fans built into it to help with keeping your computer parts cool. There are thouses of case to choose from it real depends on your personal taste and the way you want it to look. I myself like the more futurist look like the Cooler Master MasterBox TD500 ATX Mid Tower Case for 75$ or the Cooler Master MasterCase H500M ATX Mid-Tower for $190. Both come with fans can support liqute cooling but the more expensive one jut comes with more bells and whitles and the other.
